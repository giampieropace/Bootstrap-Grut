# Bootstrap-Grut

This is a simple and lightened version of Bootstrap 5 that brings together grid system and utilities only.

It is a single 121 kb minified file and adds some custom configurations:

- more spacers: added 6 (*6), 7 (*8) and 8 (*12)
- and negative margins

I hope someone else will find it useful!
